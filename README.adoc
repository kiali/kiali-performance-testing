== Description

Kiali Performance REST API Testing (aka Kiali Windsock - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsock) was inspired by Fortio (https://github.com/fortio/fortio) and RegPatrol (https://ibmcloud-perf.istio.io/regpatrol/).


== How it works

=== Dependencies needed to deploy on Openshift

[NOTE]
The following instructions assume that you have access to an OpenShift cluster, that the `oc` command is available on your path and that your current user has cluster permissions. It also assumes that you have Ansible (`ansible-playbook`) on your path


[NOTE]
You will need to deploy Kiali first.

[source,shell]
----
# Installing Dependencies Needed on Fedora (Use your distribution package manager [apt, pacman, yum or zypper])
sudo dnf install ansible python-pip

# Make sure pip is upgraded to the latest
sudo pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the openshift python client library
pip install --user openshift
----


== Deploying Dashboard (InfluxDB and Grafana) on Openshift

=== Ephemeral Dashboard

[source,shell]
----
make deploy-dashboard-ephemeral
----

=== Persistent Dashboard 

[NOTE]
Your openshift cluster will need to have 2 Persistent Storage at least **5GI**(one for InfluxDB and other for Grafana Dashboard). 


----
make deploy-dashboard-persistent
----



== Deploying Windsock

Create a `.env` file with all the required environment variables. An example env file [.env.example](.env.example) is included.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

[source,shell]
----
make deploy-performance-test
----

You can use ansible-playbook command as well:

[source,shell]
----
	ansible-playbook ansible/performance_test.yml -e kiali_hostname=kiali-istio-system.openshift.cluster.domain.com/api/status \
	-e kiali_username=admin \
	-e kiali_password=admin \
	-e test_name=test-api-status \
	-e influx_address=influxdb-kiali-windsock-dashboard.openshift.cluster.domain.com \
	-e influx_username=admin \
	-e influx_password=admin \
	-e rate=1  \
	-e duration=2000 \
	-e number_of_users=5  -v
